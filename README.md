# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Title

Wenyu's portfolio website

## My Goal

This is my website for my portfolio and for other people to get to know me a little bit more. 

## Description

I used CSS and HTML mainly to create a basic website where i will have a little information about myself, feature my future projects and provide contact information for employers who wants to know more about me. This is just a skeleton and I will add more as I go through the class for the bootcamp.
